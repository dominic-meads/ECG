# ECG

Goal: Beat detection using FPGA

## Analog Front-End
Ideas:
* TI application note: https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sbaa160a/sbaa160a.pdf \
* Right Leg Drive Circuit (and additional ECG circuit): https://www.egr.msu.edu/classes/ece480/capstone/spring13/group03/documents/ElectrocardiographyCircuitDesign.pdf \
* Video on RLD circuit (8:50): https://www.ti.com/video/6269632585001
